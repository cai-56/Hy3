| Safe JSON/Markdown/TXT import | [`imports.py`](../backend/src/replaylab/imports.py), custom-import UI | import/API/frontend regression tests | pass |
| Key remains server-side | environment-only `Hy3Settings`; health returns boolean | no-key/health tests and [security model](security.md) | pass |
| One-command local source startup | [`launcher.py`](../backend/src/replaylab/launcher.py) starts both loopback services, checks health/ports, isolates frontend credentials, and owns cleanup | fifteen launcher tests and real smoke run | pass |
| Prompt injection, references, secrets, limits | provider instruction, redaction, strict models, deterministic closure | security/provider/import regression tests | pass |
| Bounded timeout/retry/repair and provider cancellation | HTTPX timeout, three attempts, `Retry-After`, one repair; cancelled provider tasks are not retried | provider tests and 429 UI test | pass |
| Loading/stop-wait/retry/rate-limit/mobile UI | React state machine and responsive CSS; stop-wait is explicitly browser-side | component tests; 390×844 Playwright test | pass |
| Simplified-Chinese product and polished visual system | Chinese UI/API/export copy, localized fixtures, graphite/ivory three-column dashboard | [ChatGPT Web reference](design/README.md), regenerated actual-UI frames, frontend/backend/E2E tests | pass |
| Two auditable CodeBuddy collaborations | one scoped accessibility edit and one read-only mobile/error audit | [collaboration record](codebuddy-collaboration.md) | pass |
| Real Hy3 E2E for both fixtures | `replaylab-live-fixtures` | current full-annotation `hy3-preview` [2/2 result](../evals/results/stage1-2026-08-05/live-fixtures/live-fixtures-2026-08-05T020537Z.md) | pass |

| Open source | repository Apache-2.0 license | [LICENSE](../../../LICENSE) | pass |

## Differentiation audit

ReplayLab does not reuse TaskRelay branding, fixtures, tools, or code and does not depend on PR #105. It does not implement general code review or incident RCA like neighboring submissions, project planning/self-review, repository investigation, or cross-session handoff/memory. The distinguishing contract is: **find the earliest evidence-backed divergence in an imported Agent decision trace, then produce the smallest evidence-gated ordered replay**.

The upstream Issue/PR collision search and branch baseline were rechecked again on 2026-08-05. GitHub reported local base `8a12d9af87c6de173b7476daf3a53b92c683e9ec` identical to `rhinobird2026`; the issue remained open and no direct ReplayLab collision appeared. Adjacent submissions now include stronger launch and demo packaging, which is why this stage adds the source-workspace launcher and continuous recording without changing the product boundary.
